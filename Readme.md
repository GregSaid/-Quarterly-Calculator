**Description:**
Update 0.7!! In this update we changed the structure of the calculators to avoid future bugs and so that the customer has a better understanding when using it, in addition, we changed the graphic elements, removing some unnecessary ones and optimizing some. We also added a new screen for when you are approved!! (We prefer not to add a reproof screen as it conflicts with the ERROR screen! We think this might confuse some people, so we prefer not to add it...)
