## URGENT UPDATE 0.02 | Change Log

-   Sintaxe Fix **(+)**

---

**Description:**
We fixed the code syntax because directories were being cited incorrectly, causing CSS and JS files to not load correctly on the page. To fix this, we moved the “img” folder so we could reference it in the code and fixed the lines of code that cited the wrong directory! In the previous update we left the directories with "/" at the beginning, causing them to not work most of the time, so we changed it to the correct one, which is to use dots at the beginning or quote directly, like this: src ="../Example. css" | href="index.css".
